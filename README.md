# Air Quality Monitoring

## Objective
This project analyzes air quality data to understand pollution trends and compare air quality between cities.

## Data Source
The air quality data is sourced from the [OpenAQ API](https://openaq.org/), a free and open platform for accessing air quality data from around the world.

## Project Workflow
The project follows an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process and analyze the data:

1. **Extract**:  
   Collect air quality data for various cities using the OpenAQ API.
   
2. **Transform**:  
   - Process raw data to calculate pollution indices and trends.
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Aggregate data for meaningful analysis.

3. **Load**:  
   Store the processed data in an SQLite database for easy querying and analysis.

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Create dashboards to compare air quality across cities.
   - Track pollution trends over time using visualizations.

## Features
- Automated data collection from the OpenAQ API.
- Data transformation to compute pollution metrics and trends.
- Storage in an SQLite database for efficient data management.
- Interactive dashboards and visualizations for insights.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: 
  - `requests` (for API calls)
  - `pandas` (for data manipulation)
  - `sqlite3` (for database storage)
  - `matplotlib` / `plotly` / `seaborn` (for visualizations)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/air-quality-monitoring.git
   cd air-quality-monitoring

'Heads Up' You may get an error due to invalid keys to solve it you should create an account on  [OpenAQ API](https://openaq.org/) and then create a key for the API.
